# Neothesia

Neothesia is a cross-platform MIDI visualizer build in Rust.
It helps people to quickly learn how to play piano.
It takes music notes from a MIDI file as an input and displays them as colorful falling blocks on a virtual piano.

Opensource Synthesia was abandoned in favour of [closed source commercial project](https://www.synthesiagame.com/)  
Goal of this project is to bring back Opensource Synthesia to live, and make it look and work as good (or even better) than commercial Synthesia.
